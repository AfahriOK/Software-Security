# CS-305

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client Artemis Financial wanted us to evaluate their code for any security flaws and refactor it to make it secure.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I researched potential fixes for the vulnerabilities found in the static testing and suppressed the false positives from the report.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Some of the vulnerabilites didn't have a solution so it was time connsuming to research all the different vulnerabilities.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I would add input validation and set a limit on the input to prevent SQL injections and DDoS attacks.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ran the code to make sure it worked and then ran another static security test to see if any new vulnerabilites were found.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I will continue to use Maven for static testing and reviewing the OWASP.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show employers that I know safe coding practices and can evaluate code for security flaws.
